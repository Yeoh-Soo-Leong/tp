### Design & implementation

My primary contribution is in **DM3**, which involves creating and
storing the **sample study plan** and the **CEG default graduation
requirements**. This is primarily handled by the `StudyPlan`
and `Grad` classes within the `seedu.classcraft.studyplan` package.

#### **Storing and Displaying Graduation Requirements**

The **`Grad`** class is responsible for holding the fixed, default CEG core modules.

* **Implementation:** The class uses a `private static final List<String> CEG_CORE_MODULES` to store the
  module codes. This list includes samples like "CS1010", "CS2030S", and "EE2026".
* **Key Method: `getAllRequirementsDisplay()`**
    * This method generates a formatted string for display.
    * It iterates through the `CEG_CORE_MODULES`.
    * For each module code, it uses a new instance of **`ModuleHandler`** to **`createModule()`**,
      which fetches details like the full module name and prerequisites. This design decouples the
      static list of required codes from the process of fetching dynamic details.

#### **Generating the Sample Study Plan**

The **`StudyPlan`** class manages the user's study plan (a list of modules across semesters)
and includes a factory method to generate a pre-set sample plan.

* **Key Method: `createSampleStudyPlan()`**
    * This static method instantiates a new `StudyPlan` (assuming 8 semesters for the CEG course).
    * It uses the `StudyPlan`'s internal **`ModuleHandler`** to **`createModule()`** objects for
      sample modules (e.g., "CS1010", "MA1511", "CS2030S").
    * It then calls **`samplePlan.addModule(module, semester)`** to populate the plan for the
      initial semesters. For example, "CS1010" and "MA1511" are added to semester 1.
* **Design Rationale:** Generating the sample plan directly within the `StudyPlan` class via a
  factory method (`createSampleStudyPlan`) centralizes the knowledge of how a plan is structured and
  ensures that the sample plan is created using the same internal logic (`addModule`,
  `ModuleHandler`) as a user-generated plan.

### Product scope

#### Target user profile

The target user profile is **Computer Engineering (CEG) students at the NUS**, particularly those planning their module enrolment across semesters and needing to
track their progress against graduation requirements. They are familiar with NUS module codes and the
concept of module prerequisites.

#### Value proposition

ClassCraft solves the problem of manual and error-prone study planning. It provides a quick way for
CEG students to **visualize their academic journey**, ensure they meet the **default graduation
requirements**, and **check prerequisites** when adding or deleting modules, thus offering a
streamlined and guided approach to academic planning.

### User Stories

| Version | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ... |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| v1.0 | new user | see usage instructions | refer to them when I forget how to use the application |
| v1.0 | CEG student | view the sample study plan | have a baseline and understand how to structure my own plan |
| v1.0 | CEG student | view the CEG default graduation requirements | know which core modules I must take for graduation |
| v1.0 | CEG student | add a module to a specific semester | customize my study plan quickly |
| v1.0 | CEG student | remove a module from a specific semester | adjust my plan if my enrolment changes |

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The application must correctly fetch and parse module data from the **NUSMods**
  API to ensure accurate prerequisites and module details.
* **Usability:** The command-line interface must be simple and intuitive, allowing students to
  perform core actions (view, add, delete) with minimal effort.
* **Performance:** The application should respond to basic commands (add, view, delete)
  instantaneously. Module data fetching should not result in long, noticeable delays.

### Glossary

* ***NUSMods*** - A community-driven platform providing data on National University of Singapore
  (NUS) modules, including module codes, names, and prerequisites.
* ***CEG*** - Computer Engineering, the specific course of study this application is designed for.
* ***Module Handler*** - A class (`ModuleHandler.java`) responsible for fetching module data and
  creating `Module` objects, serving as a cache and factory for module-related operations.

### Instructions for manual testing

1.  **Start the application:** Compile and run the `ClassCraft` application.
2.  **View Sample Plan:** Enter the command to view the sample study plan (e.g., `view sample`).
    Verify that the output shows modules like `CS1010` and `EE2026` across different semesters.
3.  **View Graduation Requirements:** Enter the command to view the default graduation requirements
    (e.g., `view grad`). Verify that a list of core modules (e.g., `CS1010`, `CS2030S`, `EE2026`) is
    displayed along with their names and prerequisite information.
4.  **Add a Module:** Enter a command to add a module (e.g., `add CS3230 /s 5`). View the study plan
    again and confirm the module is placed in the specified semester.
5.  **Delete a Module:** Enter a command to delete a module (e.g., `delete CS3230`). View the study
    plan and confirm the module is removed.
6. **View Specialisation modules:** Enter a command to view modules that count to a certain specialisation 
    (e.g., spec ae).
